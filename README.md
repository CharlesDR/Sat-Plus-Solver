# Sat-Plus-Solver

A client-side production planner for the Satisfactory Plus (SF+) mod. It has two layers: a world of linked factories, and an LP/MILP solver inside each factory.

## Development

Requires Node 22+ and pnpm 10 (`corepack enable`).

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev         # web app
pnpm lint        # ESLint (incl. package dependency rule) + Prettier
pnpm typecheck   # tsc for every workspace
pnpm test        # Vitest
pnpm build       # production build of the web app
pnpm build:data  # data/generated/model.json + report.md
pnpm solve --target "Iron Plate:60" [--import "Iron Ingot:30"] [--objective scarcity]
```

`pnpm solve` prints one factory's plan (recipes, machines, imports, byproducts, nodes, power). Run it without arguments for every option.

| Workspace         | Role                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/data`   | Build-time pipeline: raw SF+ JSON → `model.json`      |
| `packages/solver` | Factory layer: LP/MILP model, objectives, diagnostics |
| `packages/world`  | World layer: factories, groups, links, ledgers        |
| `packages/graph`  | Flowchart / world graph construction and layout       |
| `apps/web`        | React UI                                              |
