| Workspace         | Role                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/data`   | Build-time pipeline: raw SF+ JSON → `model.json`      |
| `packages/solver` | Factory layer: LP/MILP model, objectives, diagnostics |
| `packages/world`  | World layer: factories, groups, links, ledgers        |
| `packages/graph`  | Flowchart / world graph construction and layout       |
| `apps/web`        | React UI                                              |
